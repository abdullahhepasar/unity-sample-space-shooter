I know the multiplayer system in general. For this reason, I can say that I progress easily in general.

I just tried to be careful when deciding which software patterns to use.

But while I was developing Multiplayer, I mostly used PUN2 in my games. I reviewed the documentation for general information for Fusion. But since it is basically the same system as PUN2, my learning process was fast.

I can say that I have practice because I have done basic asteroid mechanics before. While integrating the Skill system, I did the synchronization with RPC. I know this is the best way.

Overall I enjoyed the project.

Thanks
